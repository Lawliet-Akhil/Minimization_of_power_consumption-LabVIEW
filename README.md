# Minimization_of_power_consumption-LabVIEW
In this project, the main objective of this report is to minimize the Extra Power consumed by two Sample Classes and Labs than the required by making use of  day sequences and setting the time table for each day using LabVIEW Software with G-coding. Any developments/modifications are welcome

-> Follow the block diagram for the code overview

Below are the Algorithms provided for each model to help design the G-code easily
-> OVER POWER USAGE INDICATORS AND ALERTS

-> Calculating the power of the classes and labs

-> Power Calculations

-> CASE STRUCTURE FOR DAY SEQUENCE

-> TIME SYNCHRONIZATION

Note: This code is considered by taking the examples of 2 standard classrooms and 2 Labs and the day schedule. This code is found to be Effective with the G-code.
